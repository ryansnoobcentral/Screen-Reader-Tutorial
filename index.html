        To start this tutorial, we will introduce you to one of the most easily
        accessible websites, Google. Once you've navigated your way to Google's home page, 
        you will be immediately put within Google's search bar. In the case that you were not, 
        you will have to <bold>TAB</bold> about 6 times, which will then put you in the search box.
        Next, you can directly type your search in without further manipulation
        besides hitting <bold>enter</bold> to command Google to populate your search. Notice
        that when your search page populates, google will have the option to
        allow you to skip to the beginning of your search results directly. From
        here, you will need to use the key combination of <bold>control - option -
          space</bold>, which is used to click a link. Finally, once situated within the
        first search result. You then can navigate your way through the searches
        by hitting <bold>TAB</bold>. If, for some reason, you would like to read further
        about a particular search result; you can hit the key combination of
        <bold>control - option - shift - arrow down(to get to the next level of text)
          or arrow up(to get back to the top level of text)</bold>. Suppose you've found
        a result matching your expectations. You can then hit the same key
        combination of <bold>control - option - space</bold> to enter the search results
        link.
