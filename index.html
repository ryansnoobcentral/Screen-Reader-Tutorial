        Easy to Navigate Website Example:

      </h2>
      <p>
        To start this tutorial, we will introduce you to one of the most easily
        accessible websites, Google. Once you've navigated your way to Google's
        home page, you will be immediately put within Google's search bar. In
        the case that you were not, you will have to TAB about 6 times, which
        will then put you in the search box. Next, you can directly type your
        search in without further manipulation besides hitting enter to command
        Google to populate your search. Notice that when your search page
        populates, google will have the option to allow you to skip to the
        beginning of your search results directly. From here, you will need to
        use the key combination of control - option - space, which is used to
        click a link. Finally, once situated within the first search result. You
        then can navigate your way through the searches by hitting TAB. If, for
        some reason, you would like to read further about a particular search
        result; you can hit the key combination of control - option - shift -
        arrow down(to get to the next level of text) or arrow up(to get back to
        the top level of text). Suppose you've found a result matching your
        expectations. You can then hit the same key combination of control -
        option - space to enter the search results link.

      <p>
        Now, we will introduce to you one of the more difficult websites to navigate using macOS's VoiceOver, Craigslist.
        The company Craigslist has been around since 1995 and the functionality of their website sure does feel like its stuck there.
        In this tutorial, you will come to realize how inefficient navigating the Craigslist website will be under the
        direction of VoiceOver.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before you begin, make sure to have your VoiceOver turned on, this can be accessed under
        System Preferences/Accessibility/VoiceOver/Enable VoiceOver
      </p>

      <ul>

            <li>Tab/Shift-Tab to find the US link</li>
            <li>Control-Option-Space to open US link</li>
            <li>Tab 9 or 10 times (varies is you start on US or Auburn)</li>

            <li>Control-Option-Space to open post</li>
            <li>Tab/Shift-Tab to navigate through post</li>
            <li>Right and Left used to switch between photos</li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Failure</h3>
      <p>
        Craigslist fails using VoiceOver because it neglects reading the state names which categorize the cities.
        This is a problem because when navigating through the US states, if you could not see which state you are in,
        the only way to figure it out would be using the cities, but that is challenging and not everyone knows exactly which
        cities are where.
